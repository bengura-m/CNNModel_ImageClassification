# CNN Model for Image Classification

This project builds an image classification system with CNN using Tensorflow. 

The CNN Model for Image Classification is a deep learning project that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images into predefined categories. This repository contains the implementation of a CNN model, training scripts, evaluation tools, and pre-trained models for various image classification tasks.

A combination of the below techniques were experimented on to give the best performance:

 - Data normalization
 - Data augmentation
 - Normalization layers 
 - Transfer Learning
 - Ensemble Model
