# CNN Model for Image Classification

This project builds an image classification system with CNN using Tensorflow. 

A combination of the below techniques were experimented on to give the best performance:

 - Data normalization
 - Data augmentation
 - Normalization layers 
 - Transfer Learning
 - Ensemble Model
